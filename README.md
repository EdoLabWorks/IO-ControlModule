# IO-ControlModule
A lightweight device monitor and control simulator for M2M applications.

Using C# and WPF, you have the full .NET framework at your disposal for your remote monitoring and control applications.

Our focus here is to show from the web control interface how we can control in simulation - devices, instruments or machines using simple LED indicators to give us a first hand feel and insight during our initial application development process.

Also, if you press the toggle buttons on each device front-panel section, you can send an ON/OFF messages to the web control interface as well as change the button's color correspondingly. 

This application should be used together with the NodeJS web control interface.

##Installation
To give it a quick try, just open it in Visual Studio and run NodeJS web control application as a separate process.
