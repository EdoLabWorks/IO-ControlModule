Using C# and WPF, you have the full .NET framework at your disposal for your remote monitoring and control applications.

Our focus here is how we can control in simulation - devices, instruments or machines using simple LED indicators to give us a first hand feel and insight during our initial application development process.

Also, as an excercise to provide you an idea on how we can send real-time notifications to our web control interface.
Although we are using simple websocket messaging, it gives us ideas of other ways on how we can use real-time automated control for M2M applications.

Later on you can add external libraries/drivers to control real devices such as wireless I/O modules or machine/instruments for any applications you may be thinking of or planning to implement.
