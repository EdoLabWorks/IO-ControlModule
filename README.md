Using C# and WPF, you have the full .NET framework at your disposal for your remote monitoring and control applications.

Our focus here is to show how we can control in simulation - devices, instruments or machines using simple LED indicators to give us a first hand feel and insight during our initial application development process.

Also, as an excercise to provide us a simple way to send real-time notifications to our web control interface.

Although we are just using simple websocket messaging here, the same concept can be used to provide real-time control instead of just notification to our M2M applications.

This application should be used together with the NodeJS Web Control interface.

For now, just open it in debug mode in Visual Studio and run the NodeJS Web Control application.
